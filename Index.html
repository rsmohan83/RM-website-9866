<h2 id="In_h"><pre>  The Indus River System</pre></h2>
<p id="In_p">1.The river Indus rises in Tibet, near lake Mansarowar.<br><br>
    2.Flowing west,it enters India in the Ladakh District of Jammu and Kashmir.<br><br>
    3.The Satluj,the Beas,the Ravi,the Chenab,the Jhelum join together to  enter the Indus near Mithankot in Pakistan.<br><br>
    4.Beyond this,the Indus flows southwards eventually reaching the Arabian sea,east of Karanchi.<br><br>
    5.With the total length of 2,900 km ,the Indus is one of the longest rivers of the world.<br><br>
    6.A little over third of the Indus basin is located in India in the states of J&K .Himachal Pradesh and Punjab and the rest is in Pakistan.<br><br>

    <p id="brahma_p">
          1.The Brahmaputra rises in Tibet east of lake mansarowar lake.<br><br>
          2.On reaching Namcha Barwa(7757 m),it takes a 'U' turn and enters India through a deep gorge.<br><br>

         <h2 id="WEP">All definitions of Work, Energy and power</h2>
  <h5 id="Work">Work</h5>
  <p>Whenever a force makes a body move,then work is said to be done.
    ★W=F×s or W=FsCos∅
  </p>
  <br> <br>
  <h5 id="1j">One Joule of work</h5>
  <p>When a force of 1 Newton moves a body through a distance of 1 metre in its own direction,then work done is known as one joule of work.</p>
  <br><br>
  <h4 id="TW">Types of Work</h4>
  <br>
  <h5 id="+W">Positive work </h5>
  <p>Work done is positive when a force acts in the direction of motion of the body</p>
    <br><br>
  <h5 id="-W">Negative work </h5>
  <p>Work done is negative when a force acts opposite to the direction of motion of the body</p>
  <br><br>
  <h5 id="0W">Zero work </h5>
  <p>Work done is zero when a force acts at right angles to the direction of motion of the body</p>
  <br><br>
  <h5 id="Energy">Energy</h5>
  <p>Energy is capacity to do work.</p>
 <br><br>
  <h4 id="TE">Types of Energy</h4>
  <br>
  <h5 id="K.E.">Kinetic energy</h5>
  <p>Energy of a body due to its motion is called kinetic energy.
  ★K.E.=½ mv²</p>
  <br>
  <h5 id="P.E.">Potential energy</h5>
  <p>Energy of a body due to its height is called potential energy.
  ★P.E.=mgh</p>
