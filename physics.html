  <h2>Work,Power and Energy important points</h2>
  <p>Work done is positive when a force acts in the direction of motion of the body</p>
    <br><br>
  <h5 id="-W">Negative work </h5>
  <p>Work done is negative when a force acts opposite to the direction of motion of the body</p>
  <br><br>
  <h5 id="Zero_work">Zero work </h5>
  <p>Work done is zero when a force acts at right angles to the direction of motion of the body</p>
  <br><br>
  <h5 id="Energy">Energy</h5>
  <p>Energy is capacity to do work.</p>
 <br><br>
  <h4 id="TE">Types of Energy</h4>
  <br>
  <h5 id="KE">Kinetic energy</h5>
  <p>Energy of a body due to its motion is called kinetic energy.
  <br>★K.E.=½ mv²</p>
  <br>
  <h5 id="PE">Potential energy</h5>
  <p>Energy of a body due to its height is called potential energy.
  <br>★P.E.=mgh</p>
